My CircuitPython assignments


### LED Fade

##### Objective 
The objective of this assignment was to make the LED fade in and out. 

##### Lessons
We learned how to use CircuitPython/Metro and Mu. 

##### Code 

### CircuitPython Servo

##### Objective 
The objective of this assignment was to make a servo consistently sweep back and forth between 0 and 180Â°.

##### Lessons
We learned how to use capacitive touch, an entirely new concept this year. To make the servo move, you had to be touching one of two wires. The direction that the servo went in hinged on which of the wires you were touching (ex. if you touch the left wire, it will move clockwise and if you touch the right wire, it will move counterclockwise). 

### CircuitPython LCD

##### Objective 
The objective of this assignment was to make an LCD show the number of times a button had been pressed. We used a switch to determine whether it would count up or down. 

##### Lessons
We learned how to make an LCD count button presses and use a switch to alter the direction. I personally had trouble making the counter go up/down by ONLY 1.
